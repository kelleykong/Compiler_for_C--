Compiler_for_C--_language
===========================

It is a project in my junior year. It is really wonderful that you can write a whole compiler for a language. Just feel I am a god: I can make any rule for the language! But the hardest part is to try different examples for testing your compiler. When I finished coding and debugging, it is not the end. There are a long way to find wether your compiler forgets any bugs!!! I just don't want my compiler like GCC: almost only report segmentation fault. You know:).

It is implemented by C to transform Câ€” language to MIPS assembly language which can be run on SPIM simulator.
